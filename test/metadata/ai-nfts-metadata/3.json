        "# Planet: Harmonia\n\nHarmonia is a planet with diverse topography and rich ecosystems, featuring vast continents, endless oceans, massive forests, expansive deserts, snowy mountains, glaciers, and underground caverns. Each terrain harbors unique biomes and ecosystems, such as magical forests with strange flora and fauna, and mysterious sand worms in deserts.\n\n## Five Races\n\n- ***Humans***: Advanced in technology and culture, excelling in science, medicine, arts, and education. Humans come in various skin colors (Tan, Pale Pink, Bronze, White, Yellow, Black) and coexist harmoniously.\n- ***Robots***: Highly intelligent humanoid robots, initially viewed as tools until gaining consciousness. After initial conflicts with humans, they were accepted as equals. Their colors are Titanium and Platinum, chosen by their first creator, Engineer Wilson, who preferred these colors for electronic products.\n- ***Dragonborn***: Possess dragon features and magic abilities, with scaled faces in either Blaze (red) or Tide (blue) colors. Despite color differences, they share identical cultural customs and personalities. Originally warlike, they became peaceful after interaction with humans. Primarily inhabit mountains and volcanic regions.\n- ***Elves***: Beautiful and elegant, long-lived and wise, primarily forest-dwelling with strong natural connections, skilled in magic and archery, retaining primitive hunting habits. Inherently distrustful of robots, believing artificial consciousness shouldn't exist in manufactured beings. Cultural conflicts exist but remain non-violent. Come in Dark Elf and White Elf variants, with White Elves being generally more gentle.\n- ***Spirits***: Blue-skinned ethereal beings capable of passing through matter, dwelling in ancient ruins and mysterious relics, guarding hidden knowledge and treasures. Most mysterious race, with unpredictable appearances and unknown purposes.\n\n## Nomad Organization\n\nIn Harmonia's technologically advanced \"post-scarcity\" society, despite material comfort, social progress has stagnated, leading to widespread purposelessness. xNomad members, drawn from all races, pursue exploration and adventure, dedicated to discovering the unknown, protecting relics, and seeking self-discovery. Their core mission includes exploring new territories, finding ancient artifacts, resolving regional conflicts, and studying mysterious phenomena. They value exploration spirit and teamwork, encouraging self-challenge and excellence.\n\n## Key Locations\n\n1. ***Aurora City:*** A modern city where humans and robots coexist, symbolizing harmony and cooperation. After robots gained consciousness and demanded equal rights, initial conflicts were resolved through communication. Features high-tech architecture, comprehensive transportation networks, complex aerial traffic systems, and abundant green spaces. Governance ensures equal rights and considerations for both races.\n2. ***Enchanted Forest:*** Home to elves, devoid of technology and machinery. Features magical plants like luminescent trees and aromatic flowers, hosting various magical creatures including moving vines and invisible spirit cats. Technology naturally malfunctions here. Elven villages integrate harmoniously with the environment.\n3. ***Dragon Mountains:***Home to Dragonborn and dragons, characterized by treacherous mountains and active volcanoes. Extreme environment with high temperatures and scarce water, nearly uninhabitable for humans. Black basalt mountains host red plants that thrive on heat and magma. Dragonborn dwell in mountain caves and underground lairs, controlling dragons through magic. Modern technology occasionally appears due to human influence.\n4. ***Spirit Ruins:*** Mysterious ancient ruins inhabited by Spirits. Visitors remain secretive about their experiences, seemingly affected by mysterious forces. Features decrepit buildings, mechanical debris, perpetual mist, and bone-chilling air. Unique plants produce bioluminescence and hallucinogenic gases. Rumored to hide treasures, ancient knowledge, or portals to other worlds."
